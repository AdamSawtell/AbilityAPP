## Verification pipeline (every slice)

| Tier | Who | When | Required? |
|------|-----|------|-----------|
| **1 — Automated** | Agent | Every slice before push | ✅ Yes — `npm run build`, `npm run page-guides:check`; `supabase:push-remote` if migration |
| **2 — Browser smoke** | Agent | Any slice that changes UI | ✅ Yes — follow **What you can test** for that slice |
| **3 — Bugbot review** | Agent | Before every `git push` to `main` | ✅ Yes — fix Critical/High before push |
| **4 — Your spot-check** | Adam | After push (Amplify live) | Recommended — same steps as Tier 2 |

### Documentation pipeline (every slice)

| Deliverable | Who | When | Required? |
|-------------|-----|------|-----------|
| **User how-to** | Agent | Same slice as the feature | ✅ Yes — article section with steps in `web/src/lib/help/articles/` |
| **System setup** | Agent | Same slice as the feature | ✅ Yes — checklist in `module-setup-guides.ts`; reference data + role grants named |
| **Progress log** | Agent | Before push | ✅ Yes — row in **User guides & system setup** below + **Guide delivery log** |

See [BUILD-EXPECTATIONS.md](./BUILD-EXPECTATIONS.md) §8 for file paths and checklist format.

## Entity link matrix

Governance: [BUILD-EXPECTATIONS.md](./BUILD-EXPECTATIONS.md) §14. Every operational record must link to the right client, employee, location, or upstream document.

| Record | Required links | Reverse UI (parent) | Save compliance |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Service agreement | client, price list | Client → Service agreements | lifecycle validation |
| Service booking | client, service agreement (when funded) | Client → Service bookings | `booking-compliance.ts` |
| Incident | client | Client → Incidents | workflow rules |
| Task | entityType + entityId | Client → Requests | — |
| Timesheet / roster shift | employee, client, location, booking | roster week view | `roster-shift-conflicts.ts` blocks double-book |
| Roster of care | client, service agreement (optional) | Client → Roster of care | weekly template + publish from Rostering |

## How to update this file

1. After each slice: update chunk %, WP slice status, overall %, shipped log.
2. Add **What you can test** rows for the new slice (table format above).
3. Add **User guides & system setup** row with user steps, reference data, role access, and admin verify.
4. Log Tier 1 / 2 / 3 results in the verification tables; log guides in **Guide delivery log**.
5. Set **Next slice** to the first incomplete item on the critical path.
